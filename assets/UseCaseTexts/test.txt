I have already approved and forwarded. How are we handling others in that group? Is she done yet? Michael has his holiday performance. Here's the talking points for ANNGTC. Very foggy this AM.

A bit behind on my emails. What is your issue sir? Paige is gone. I'm in the waiting room of the ENT now. Check with Haedicke Is Cassandra there today? Shouldn't be too hard though. In a couple of weeks. I will call in 20 to 30 minutes. This is the neatest toy I have had. No, but thanks. Can we go to 150/150 with Foster? Surely we can cover this from within Virgo's team?
